			<p><span>What is the difference between these two statements? </span></p>

<p><span>1. The House is on Fire. </span></p>

<p><span>2. I believe the statement “the House is on Fire” is true. </span></p>

<p><span><span>As far as truth claims, there is no difference. But in terms of tone, it can make all the difference in the world. And tone comes from consciousness. Conscious comes from the Latin <em>con </em>+ <em>scio</em> meaning “I know with.”</span></span></p>

<p>But what is it we “know with?”</p>

<p>Words.</p>

<p>The consequence of those <em>overly</em>-conscious can, then, drive one mad. If the <em>overly</em>-conscious <em>always</em> thinks, “I believe ‘x’ is true,” there would be constant reassessment of all truths. This is the logical extension of the Cartesian principle “doubt all things until proven true.” The constant application of this principle, in the way I have outlined, results in madness. The mind feels always assaulted by the need to justify itself rather than just think; thus, one is left to pacing about his house, repeating what he thinks; there cannot be progress.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</p>

<p><span><span>However, if that is true then our only option in order to have faith is to doubt doubt itself. This is the ultimate critique of this skepticism. But why must we doubt doubt itself, if <em>all reasoning</em> is in question? Then there cannot be a reason to doubt doubt itself. Therefore, we must give a reason to doubt doubt itself? But this is absurd; yet, we must do it if we are to trust anything to be true.</span><span> </span></span></p>

<p><span>Perhaps we approach wrongly. Because one does not trust his wife for <em>a </em>reason and yet, one’s trust is not unreasonable for both have made a commitment to each other. This is because one’s wife has shown her faithfulness to her husband. This cannot be “logically proven” but still it is <em>seen</em>—that is, it is experienced in history. Hindsight is 20/20 and so, the husband trusts in his wife’s faithfulness which is to say he trusts in the wife herself. One believes the statement “my wife is faithful” is true. Yet one would not think “I believe the statement ‘My wife is faithful’ is true,” one would simply believe that his wife is faithful.</span></p>

<p>Further, if one were to demand that his wife <em>prove</em> her faithfulness, then it would imply that we see her as unfaithful. Consequently, the demanding of proof means doubting. Conversely, to doubt means one has seen the proof; for one cannot doubt what one has not seen. Hence, to earnestly doubt is to <em>implicitly</em> profess faith. &lt;/span&gt;</p>

<p><span>Are we not like the husband and is not God like the wife?</span></p>

<p>I have doubted that God has snatched a small, weak, slave nation, Israel, out of the oppressive hands of a greater nation, Egypt. Further, I have doubted that I have been a slave to something (<strong><em>sex</em></strong>? <strong><em>drugs</em></strong>? <strong><em>money</em></strong>?) and that I have been delivered. I have doubted that God Himself sent His Own Son to deliver us, like He did Israel, through His Own death. I have doubted God’s faithfulness. I have doubted God Himself. It is because of I have earnestly doubted God’s faithfulness that I<em> implicitly</em> professed faith for I have <em>seen </em>His faithfulness.<em></em> And, if I have seen it implicitly, then I cannot help but proclaim explicitly. Otherwise, I will not be earnest.</p>

<p>How did I come to <em>implicitly </em>profess faith?</p>

<p>That is a great mystery. How can a man explain what he has seen; he can only admit that he <em>saw</em> it. Similarly, one can not explain why one has faith, only <em>that</em> one possesses it.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;</p>
