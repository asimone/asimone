			<a href="#skipheader"><h2>Liberal Education</h2></a>
			<p>The question of what makes a free man is quite contemporary and yet I wonder why the culture as a whole gives such little thought to the sort of education we ought to provide. Even the institutions themselves, overly-concerned with the business, neglet their proper end. There is little liberality and even less education and it sickens me. Peter Berkowitz, tackling the problem, <a href="http://www.hoover.org/publications/policyreview/4884276.html">pens aptly</a>:</p>
<blockquote>The dominant opinion proclaims that no shared set of ideas, no common body of knowledge, and no baseline set of values or virtues marking an educated human being exist. To be sure, the overwhelming majority of all American colleges adopt a general distribution requirement. Usually this means that students must take a course or two of their choosing in the natural sciences, social sciences, and the humanities, with perhaps a dollop of fine arts thrown in for good measure. And all students must choose a major.
</blockquote>

<p>What Berkowitz is recognizing is an inability to see a unity because of the excessive paranoia of violence to ‘The Other’ has caused a rift in different avenues of knowledge. (The irony, of course, lies in the ubiquity of perspectives in the different departments.)</p>

<p>Personally, I think this transcends the epistemic problem of how we relate different bodies of knowledge and pushes forward to a broader metaphysical question: how are the universal and particular (un)related? It is a perennial question and, I think, it will <em>always be </em>a perennial question. Nevertheless, the answerable question must be found <em>for us</em>, now: this must neccesarily reach back into the ‘historical’ perspectives but still find contextualization (a loathesome word) in our contemporary world.</p>
